This assignment is comprised of Machine Learning Modeling & Analysis on 2 datasets:

1. ExoPlanet Identification
Original Dataset URL: 
https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative
Website: 
https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html
https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/

2. Wine Quality Prediction
Original Dataset URL: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

I have done some data pre-processing (Changing names, handling missing values etc.) on the original dataset above
and saved the .csv files in my repository that I am sharing with you:
https://www.github.com/

I have separated my code based on 5 different ML Algorithms.

These are the five Python 3.x files (I have used Microsoft Visual Studio Python IDE to build and execute my code):

1. DecisionTreeWithCurves.py
2. BoostingWithCurves.py
3. KNNWithCurves.py
4. SVMWithCurves.py
5. NeuralNetworkWithCurve.py


Note: Please update the code to get the address of the saved .csv data files in your personal computer that I have attached in my repository 
and then run the code.

P.S. I only split into Training and Testing datasets and hence you will see me using Validation and Testing terms interchangeably.Please consider this for my analysis.
